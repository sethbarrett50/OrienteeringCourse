# Orienteering Course Solver

Welcome to the repository for our orienteering course solver program.

The goal of this program is to be able to solve an orienteering course that centers around a central line with start and end points on it. The program will use various algorithms and techniques to navigate the course and find the most efficient route from start to finish.

We hope that this program will be useful for orienteering enthusiasts and competitors, as well as for those interested in studying and optimizing route-finding algorithms.

Thank you for your interest in our project.
